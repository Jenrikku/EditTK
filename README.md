# EditTK

EditTK is a Framework for 3D Level Editors or any kind of 3D Editor really, 
it's a spiritual successor to the [GL_EditorFramework](https://github.com/jupahe64/GL_EditorFramework) and will be used  for all future Editors (once it's done)
The Frameworks graphics are powerd by [veldrid](https://github.com/mellinoe/veldrid) and as such supports OpenGL 3, Direct3D 11 and Vulkan (Metal has not been tested yet).
And for UI it uses ImGUI

It's heavily WIP
